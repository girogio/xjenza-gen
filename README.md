# xjenza-gen

This tool is a Python-based utility designed to automate the process of creating
and compiling LaTeX documents.

## Overview

The LaTeX Document Builder takes an `Article` object as input, which contains
the content of the article in LaTeX format. It then writes this content to a
`.tex` file, compiles the `.tex` file into a `.pdf` file, runs the `biber`
command to process the bibliography in the `.tex` file, and then compiles the
`.tex` file into a `.pdf` file two more times. This is necessary as LaTeX
sometimes requires multiple passes to resolve all references correctly.

## Prerequisites

To run this tool successfully, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or later (I'll assume you have this already)
- LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX)
- `make` utility (optional)
- `biber` bibliography tool

### macOS

If you don't have a package manager installed, I recommend installing
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
brew install make biber texlive
```

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install make biber texlive-full
```

## Usage

Firstly, we clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:girogio/xjenza-gen.git
cd xjenza-gen
```

Then, we install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, we can edit the existing `main.py` file to create our own document. The
`main.py` file contains a basic example of how to use the LaTeX Document Builder
to create a document.

Once done, we can make use of the `Makefile` to quickly build and clean up any unwanted build artifacts generated by pdflatex:

```bash
make build
```

## Example

Here is a basic example of how to use `xjenza-gen`

```python
# File: main.py

from article import Article, Author
from latex import LatexEngine

# Initialize the latex engine
latex = LatexEngine(
    template_folder="template",
    template_file="main.tex",
    output_folder="outputs",
    output_file="main.tex",
)

# Create some authors
authors = [
    Author("John", "Doe", "john@doe.com", "University of Malta").corresponding(),
    Author("Jane", "Doe", "jane@doe.com", "Univerity of Nowhere"),
    Author("Mark", "Dudinu", "dudino@mark.com", "University of Nowhere"),
]

# Create an article
my_article = Article("A very interesting article", authors=authors)

# Write the article to a tex file
latex.write_tex(my_article)

# Build the article
pdf_path = latex.build(my_article)

print(f"PDF saved to {pdf_path}")

```

This will create a .tex file with the content of the `Article` object, compile
it into a `.pdf` file run `biber` to process the bibliography, and then compile
the `.tex` file into a `.pdf` file two more times to ensure all references are
resolved correctly.
